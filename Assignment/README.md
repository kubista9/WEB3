# UNO Game Project

A multiplayer UNO card game implemented with Vue.js, GraphQL, Node.js, and MongoDB.

## How to run

in the root

    npm install

for client

    npm run dev

for server, you need docker and you need to have a running mongo:db container

install via

    docker pull mongo:latest

then run the container, for example

    docker run -d -p 27017:27017 --name mongodb mongo:latest
  
verify

    docker ps

create .env file in the /server folder, example

    MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/uno-game
    CLIENT_URL=http://localhost:5173
    NODE_ENV=development
    JWT_SECRET=supersecretkey12345

then start the server via

    npm run dev

open in browser

    http://localhost:5173/

- register
- login
- create a game
- play

## Known bugs

### Start game button

Sometimes it can happen that if you register and log in as another user in a new tab and join a game, 
the Start Game button sometimes doesn’t appear in the host window.
To solve this, log out and log back in from the host browser window.

### Automatic redirect as a guest

When you start a game as a host, it automatically redirects you to the game page —
but not for guests.
So as a guest you need to paste the /game/:id manually in your browser.

### Card in the game page

Sometimes the player card in Game page have written on them "NUMBER" instead of the actual number "9" or "OTHER"

### Game Logic

it is possible to play most cards on top of the discard pile ( weak validation )

## Requirements

### Assignment 2

Combined with assignment 3 with real players
- screen for setting up a game ( lobby )
- screen for playing ( game )
- implemented with vue.js
- using consistent composition API
- it has a GameOverview screen but it is not used. It is available at /game/:id/overivew with mockup data

### Assignment 3

- can play against 1-3 human opponents
- users can identify themselves
- users can create a game
- users can join existing game
- users get notified when something happens
- the server uses GraphQL communication protocol
- user registration and login
- server uses Apollo server

## Tests passed

The number of tests passed/failed oscillates because of the randomizer but it should pass approximately 195+- tests
- 40 failed, 198 passed (19.10)

## Notes

- In the model/ there were the following changes in the naming convention: DRAW -> DRAW CARD & WILD -> WILD CARD

- All css was autogenerated
